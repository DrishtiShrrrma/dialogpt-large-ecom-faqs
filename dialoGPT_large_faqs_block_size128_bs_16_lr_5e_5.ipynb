        "- Minimum Length: The smallest length is 24. If BLOCK_SIZE is set to be less than this, then we'll be truncating some of the text.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Maximum Length: The largest length is 1140 and model's maximum token size is less than this, we need to truncate or find a way to handle longer sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Most Common Ranges: The majority of text lengths are well below 200 tokens, with a significant number below 100. This suggests that a smaller block size may be generally sufficient for most entries.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Memory Efficiency: If we set the BLOCK_SIZE to a high value (like 1024 or 2048), this will consume more memory and may be overkill for the majority of your entries that are much shorter. It might make training inefficient.\n",
